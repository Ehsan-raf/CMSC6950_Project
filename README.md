argopy is a Python program for performing statistics on [Argo data](http://www.argo.ucsd.edu/) and creating global statistics atlases. The tools enable hundreds of cores to brew the Argo database's over two million profiles. It aims to make it easier for normal users, professionals, and operators to access, visualize, and manage Argo data.
